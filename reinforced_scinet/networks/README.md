# Networks

The various network models which have been employed within the project.

## base_networks

The base networks which make up the algorithm.

+ `DenseEncoder`: Dense neural network which is an encoder to an autoencoder model.
+ `DenseDecoder`: Dense neural network which is a decoder to an autoencoder model.
+ `DenseAutoencoder`: Autoencoder from dense neural networks.
+ `Selection`: Neural network model for selection neurons.
+ `DeepPS`: Deep neural network for deep energy-based projective simulation.
